We promote these while\nmaintaining a goal of preserving our assets and consolidating our country’s\ncalling as a land of encounter, liberty, and tolerance - a global objective in which\nour Kingdom takes deep pride.\nIn 1995, our monarch, King Hassan II, seeking to enrich our educational\nsystem through the establishment of a new university, challenged the founders\nto create an organizational, pedagogical, and scientific structure inspired from\nthe most effective models. AUI, modeled in its administrative, pedagogical, and\nacademic organization on the American university system, is meant to be a\nforum for creativity and human progress in all fields of knowledge, as well as a\nvenue for cooperation and understanding among peoples and civilizations.\nSince its inception, the University has manifested its wish to contribute to the\ntraining of highly qualified professionals and executives, people committed to\nthe quest for knowledge and culture and imbued with the values of human\nsolidarity and tolerance.\nIn addition to a global focus, the University desires that the education imparted\ngrant a special status to the Arabic language and the Arab-Islamic culture at all\neducational levels and majors. While adopting the English language as the\nmain medium of instruction, we also offer a range of courses in Arabic and\nFrench.\nWithin the framework of the Dahir-bearing law, Al Akhawayn University works\nto establish cooperative relations with universities and other national and\ninternational organizations concerned with education and research. It strives\nalso to enter cooperative relations with public and private entities from various\nsectors of the national economy."

AUI Need-Based Grants\nUniversity assistance is granted on a very limited basis. Students do not have\nto repay grants. Grants are awarded in the form of a fixed amount that goes\nexclusively towards tuition to prospective students with demonstrated financial\nneed and commendable academic records. The amount granted to students\nshould not exceed the amount paid for tuition.\nGrants come in the form of funds (endowments) held by the University or\ndonations (private, semi-private, or state donations). Donation providers are\nmainly local communities, companies, banks, board members, ministries,\nsocial charity organizations, international or Moroccan charities, and socio-\ncultural associations. Contributions from individual benefactors are included in\nthis group. Special nominal scholarships are also available. Such information\nmay be obtained from the Financial Aid Office. Newly admitted financial aid\napplicants should confirm their admission to AUI by paying a deposit of 25000\ndhs so that their files can be reviewed by the financial aid committee.\n2. AUI-Approved Bank Loans “Avenir Plus” or State Guaranteed\nLoan with CCG (Caise Centrale de Garantie)\nAl Akhawayn University has convened agreements with a national bank for a\nloan program that will serve the interests of students and at the same time\nenable them to contribute substantially toward financing of their own studies.\nStudent loans are offered for the purpose of meeting the costs of studies at\nAUI. They are available to all interested students for any semester while the\nbank bases the final decision on adequate supporting documentation.\n-\nLoan Terms and Amounts\n\nUndergraduate Students\nThe loan program will provide qualified students with long-term loans payable\nover an extended period with 0% annual interest rate , as the interest is\nsupported by AUI .

These part-time job earnings are directly remitted to the student’s\nbalance to cover fees and tuition costs .\nStudents should not work during hours they are scheduled to be in class. Most\njobs require from 8 to 10 hours of work per week (160 hours maximum per\nsemester should be managed by the part time job students depending on their\ntime availability).\nThe total hours required to work per week may be exceeded in order to make\nup for missing hours caused by absence, vacation, late assignments, and/or\nexam periods. This exception also applies to some scholarship holders who\nare required to work a minimum of 5 hours/week. However, any part time job\nstudent’s absence from the assigned post or other new arrangement must be\napproved by the part time job supervisor.\nCampus employment is very limited.

The sibling\ndiscount can be used for a maximum of 8 semesters for undergraduate\nstudents and 4 semesters for graduate students with the possibility to apply for\nan extension for an additional semester if needed.

Among the study abroad\nprograms available to students, exchange programs are the most popular and\nare designed primarily for undergraduate students to exchange places with\nstudents from other institutions with which the university has signed\nagreements stipulating student payment requirements to the home and host\ninstitutions. The exchange is generally for one semester, although there are\nexceptions. Study abroad experiences generally have a limit of one calendar\nyear, i.e. two full semesters and a summer session.\nTransfer of Credits\nFor all study abroad programs, the credits that a student obtains at the host\nuniversity can be transferred to equivalent courses at AUI, provided that the\nstudent enrolls in courses for which approval from the appropriate AUI school\nhad been given. Programs have different criteria, and students are encouraged\nto read the announcements and plan carefully for their international study\nexperience.\nIn addition to full term exchange or study abroad programs, AUI also organizes\nshorter-term faculty-led international trips for AUI academic credit. Finally, AUI\nalso organizes non-credit international trips, particularly through student\nactivities.

        "chunk_text": "It is the aim of the faculty to foster a spirit of honesty and a high standard of\nintegrity. The instructor of a course is responsible for initiating action against\ndishonesty or plagiarism that occurs in class. In cases of convincing evidence\nof academic dishonesty such as cheating, plagiarism, or falsification, an\ninstructor should take appropriate action. Before taking such action, however,\nthe instructor should attempt to discuss the matter with the student.\nCheating\nComplete honesty is required of students in the presentation of any phase of\ncourse work as their own. This applies to quizzes of any length, as well as to\nall examinations, daily reports, lab work, and term papers. Instances of\ncheating include, but are not limited to:\n\nDishonesty on examinations and quizzes or on written assignments,\n\nIllegal possession of examinations,\n\nThe use of unauthorized notes during an examination or quiz,\n\nInformation obtained from the examination paper or from another student,\n\nCollaboration with other students in cheating,\n\nAlteration of grade records, and\n\nIllegal entry into or unauthorized presence in an office.\nPlagiarism\nAny attempt by students to present another person’s words, content or ideas\nas their own is regarded by the faculty and administration as a most serious\noffense. Offenders are subject to serious consequences, including possible\nexpulsion.\nWriters, artists, and all others involved in creative endeavors must always\nmake a clear distinction between what words, images, ideas, and arguments\nare original to them; and what words, images, ideas, and arguments are\nborrowed (taken) from the work of others. Failure to disclose this distinction to\nreaders/viewers of one’s creative work, via citations, footnotes, and proper\nattributions (no matter how small or large, how formal or informal the work)\nconstitutes plagiarism.\nSeveral courses at AUI teach undergraduate students the formalities of\nproperly crediting sources in their work. Some graduate programs teach these\nformalities as well. When members of the AUI community – faculty, staff,\nadministration, or student – doubt the legitimacy of someone’s work regarding\nthe requirements for crediting sources, they may consult reference books in\nthe main office of their academic or support unit. Faculty members are\nexpected to make their practices clear to their students, and unit heads to their\nstaff. In addition, it is the general policy of the University that willfully ignoring\nthe principle of academic honesty – once taught – and the formalities regarding\ncitation for one’s discipline, will result in heavy penalties, including failure in a\ncourse, suspension from the university, or expulsion."

If a course is repeated, the highest grade earned is the\ngrade used to compute the cumulative grade point average (CGPA) for all\npurposes. Repeated courses are counted only once for credit.\nAn undergraduate course in which a grade of C or higher has been earned may\nnot be repeated for credit. A student may repeat any course in which a C-or\nlower has been earned.\nNormally a student is allowed to repeat a course only once. If a required course\nis failed a second time, a student may, after consulting with the advisor and the\nschool coordinator, appeal to the school dean for permission to take the course\na third time.\nAcademic Probation\nUndergraduate students are placed on academic probation if their GPA falls\nbetween 1.5 and 1.99. This probationary status serves as a warning to students\nthat their performance is below the level required. Students on academic\nprobation may not exceed four courses (up to 13 semester hours) in the\nsubsequent regular semester. To return to satisfactory standing at the end of\nthis semester requires a semester GPA of 2.00 or greater. Performance in a\nsummer session or intersession does not grant a return to a satisfactory\nstanding. No notation of academic probation appears on the transcript.\nUnsatisfactory Standing\nUndergraduate students are considered to have an unsatisfactory standing if\ntheir semester GPA is less than 1.5. Students at this level must appeal and\nobtain special permission from the Committee on Student Standing before they\ncan re-enroll. Students with an unsatisfactory standing may not exceed four\ncourses (up to 13 semester hours) in the subsequent regular semester and\nmay be limited to an even lighter load.\nTo return to a satisfactory standing at the end of the semester requires a\nsemester GPA of 2.00 or greater. Performance in a summer session or\nintersession does not grant return to a satisfactory standing. No notation of\nacademic probation appears on the transcript.\nAcademic Dismissal\nUndergraduate students on academic probation have 2 semesters or 12 credits\n(whichever occurs first) to raise their GPA to 2.00. Failure to raise the GPA to\n2.00 after 2 semesters on academic probation may result in suspension or\ndismissal from the University. Students not allowed to take a full load may refer\nto the Probation Regulations and Procedures table for details. In cases of\nextenuating circumstances, students may appeal their suspension or dismissal.\nStudents on probation who fail to achieve a semester GPA of 2.00 in any two\nsemesters (not necessarily consecutive) are subject to dismissal. Probation\nsemesters are cumulative. However, the probationary history is cleared after 2\nsemesters in good academic standing with a full load minimum of 12 SCH\n(summer session/intersession are excluded)."

Its main mission is to\nprepare the students enrolled for academic programs offered in English, which\naligns with AUI’s mission to prepare future leaders of Morocco and the world.\nIn addition to English, the LC offers programs in other languages such as\nFrench, Spanish, and Tamazight.\nLC Mission Statement\nThe Language Center seeks to: 1) equip eligible students with the language\nskills necessary for success in their academic studies using materials that\npromote global multicultural awareness and 2) provide tailored-made language\ntraining programs for the AUI community and other clients.\nWith the fostering of student learning as its primary focus, the LC provides\ncourses and extracurricular activities designed to develop the four language\nskills while integrating grammar and vocabulary in a learner-centered\nenvironment.\nThe LC faculty is experienced, culturally diverse, and committed to\nprofessional development. The use of modern technology and authentic\nmaterials contributes to an effective teaching/learning environment where"

The LC wants to be known among\nstudents, parents, and educators for providing a stimulating academic\nenvironment and a challenging student-centered curriculum that motivates,\nchallenges, and educates all students. Values\n1. Excellence\n2. Equity\n3. Integrity\n4. Transparency\n5. Equal opportunity\n6. Collaboration\nPhilosophy\nThe essence of the LC philosophy is to encourage an open approach to\nmethodologies of language teaching; teachers are allowed to use their own\nteaching styles, as long as they meet the objectives of the curriculum. They are\nalso encouraged to be eclectic and creative vis-à-vis the use of teaching\nmaterials and techniques. The LC’s overarching teaching philosophy and\npedagogy is geared towards a communicative, learner-centered approach.\nIntended Learning Outcomes\nUpon successful completion of the LC intensive English Program, students\nshould be able to:\n1. Recognize and analyze different kinds of academic discourse,\n2. Communicate in English with fluency, appropriateness, and accuracy,\n3. Demonstrate basic critical thinking when interacting with complex academic\ntexts and when producing written and spoken forms of language,\n4. Use English to boost their competence in learning academic disciplines,\n5. Use pre- and post-learning techniques and strategies vertically between\nskill levels and horizontally across skill areas in multi-layered academic\ncontexts,\n6. Become autonomous and effective learners.\nLanguage Center Practices\nTo meet the above goals, the LC has designed a curriculum based on the four\nskills of writing, reading, listening, and speaking. These are grouped into three\nareas: Academic Writing and Grammar, Academic Listening and Speaking,\nand Academic Reading. Each area is distributed across three levels and each\ncourse has its own description, objectives, ILOs, materials, and evaluation\ncriteria. In measuring the student’s proficiency in the main languages it offers,\nthe University utilizes a set of internationally recognized standardized tests to\nproperly place students: TOEFL or equivalent (e.g. IELTS) for English and\nTCF, TFI, DALF, or DELF for French."

For this reason, and because they will negatively\nimpact students’ acquisition, performance, and consequently, their grades,\nabsences are discouraged and limited by regulation. After exceeding the\nmaximum number of tolerated absences (5 absences for classes taught three\ntimes a week and 7 absences for classes that meet five times days a week), a\nstudent receives a WF and is withdrawn from the course in question.\nPrograms\nThe Intensive English Program (IEP) constitutes the main activity of the\nLanguage Center. Undergraduate students whose entry scores are below ITP\n530 or equivalent scores are placed in this program. They may take up to three\nEnglish courses per semester - at level one, level two, or a combination of the\ntwo - depending on their TOEFL scores and sub-scores, and on their results in\nthe LC-developed Writing Placement Test (WPT). Students who score below\n420 will take the pre-academic courses.\nThe LC also offers special programs, such as English for AUI Staff (a-k-a EFS)\nand Corporate English Language Training (CELT) to clients outside the\nUniversity. In addition to English courses, the Center also offers courses in\nother languages for credit, namely French, German, Korean, Spanish, and\nTamazight/Berber.\nIEP: Intensive English Program\nAt each of the three levels, IEP consists of two courses of 75 contact hours per\nsemester (Reading and Listening/Speaking) and one course of 150 contact\nhours (Writing and Grammar).

The program review is a\ntwo-day period at the end of the spring semester during which faculty raise and\ndiscuss issues related to student responses to ILO surveys and to faculty\nreflections on course content, assessment, materials, and other relevant\naspects of the program. The results of these discussions inform any changes\nto the LC English curriculum.\nCoordination\nTo ensure a smooth and effective delivery of the program, the Academic\nCoordinator meets regularly with the LC Director. He also sits with English\nteachers at regular coordination meetings to address a wide variety of issues\nranging from teaching methodologies, intended learning outcomes, writing and\ngrading quizzes, midterms and finals, to sharing and discussing teaching\nmaterials.\nOther Languages\nFrench\nThe second most important language taught in the Language Center is French.\nCourses in French are offered at different levels, ranging from beginner to\nproficiency. These courses can be taken to either satisfy specific degree\nrequirements or as electives (see details under the Course Descriptions section\nof the catalog).\nTwo different types of French programs are available: French as a Foreign\nLanguage (FRE), mostly for international students, and French as a Second\nLanguage (FRN), for Moroccan students.\nNewly admitted students are required to take a placement test in French or\nbring in a French test certificate.
